<h3>Using accounts</h3>

On this website, an account is only needed if you want to save the current
state of the application. Without an account, the page will load in the same
state every time; with an account, the page will load as you left it when you
closed the page (or logged out).

<h4>Logging in</h4> 

When you see the option to log in, simply type your email and password, and
hit enter or the login button. 

If you don't have a account, click on <u><b>create an account</b></u> on the
same screen. If you don't want to create an account, click <u><b>SKIP</b></u>;
the only disadvantage is that your work won't be saved.

<h4>Creating an account</h4>

When you open the page, the login dialog allows you to create an account. If
you skipped that, you can open the login dialog also by clicking on the
account icon (the icon in the top row that looks like a pawn). To create an
account, you'll need to fill in an email address and a password. The only
restrictions are that the password must contain 8 characters or more, and that
the email address is valid, and isn't already associated with an account.

<h4>Logging out</h4> 

You don't have to log out, but the option is available under the account icon
after logging in. 

<h4>Privacy policy</h4> 

We only use your email address for authentication and resetting your password.
